# Operating Systems
## Pqueue
Implements a priority queue using a linked list structure (PQueueNode). This priority queue is designed to hold elements with associated priorities, and the elements are ordered in the queue based on their priorities.

## Schedular
Implements a scheduling simulation for two scheduling algorithms: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) and Shortest Job First (SJF). 

## Synchronization
Implements a multi-producer, multi-consumer problem using pthreads and a shared buffer. It simulates the interaction between producers and consumers and demonstrates thread synchronization using mutex locks.

## Threads
Performs parallel counting using multiple threads to count the number of elements in an array that satisfy the given condition.
